## Overview
CDS does not have a native 1:1 realtionship. As a workaround, you generally have to use a 1:many relationship and live with a subgrid on the form. This PCF renders a grid of one record as a more traditional looking list of fields within a section giving it a more native look.

From a user's perspective, they can clearly see the information they need without the need of the additional grid elements that muddy the user experience.

## Features/Considerations
- The control uses the columns in a standard view to display them as traditional fields in a section.
- The control is best used on an entity form sub-grid.
- You need to set the filters on your view to ensure that only a single record is returned. If you dont, RTFM.
- You can select the title of the card by specifying the logical name of the target field. The field must be in view.
